						The objective was
						to gain insights into the trends and patterns of movie ratings over the course of a decade,
						providing valuable information for filmmakers, production companies, and movie enthusiasts. To
						conduct this analysis, I gathered data from the IMDb database, including movie titles, release
						years, genres, ratings, and user reviews. The dataset consisted of over 10,000 movies released
						between 2006 and 2016.</p>

					<p>I conducted an in-depth analysis of the sales data for a company to uncover valuable insights and
						provide actionable recommendations. The objective of this project was to help the company gain a
						better understanding of its sales performance, identify trends, and optimize sales strategies to
						drive growth and maximize revenue.
						To conduct this analysis, I collected sales data from the company's databases, which included
						information such as sales transactions, customer demographics, product details, pricing, and
						promotional activities. The data covered a specific time period, typically ranging from months
						to years, depending on the availability of data.</p>
